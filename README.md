# üó£Ô∏è ShadowVCMod

> Ambient sound awareness for Minecraft entities.

**ShadowVCMod** is a backend utility mod providing real-time voice detection capabilities for Minecraft mobs. Built as a modular system intended for a larger mod, it introduces environmental audio awareness based on player speech captured through **Voice Changer API**, commissioned by Shadow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Functionality

- **Voice Capture Integration**: Hooks into OpenAL audio streams to monitor player voice levels in real time.
- **Threshold-Based Detection**: Calculates active decibel levels and triggers events once a configurable threshold is exceeded.
- **Entity Targeting Logic**: Grants mobs the ability to target to nearby players **based solely on detected voice volume**.
- **Decoupled Design**: Can be easily extended into broader AI behavior trees, sound-based stealth mechanics, or ambient event triggers.

## üì¶ Intended Use

- Designed to serve as a **base module** for larger mods introducing stealth, horror, or ambient survival mechanics.
- Focuses exclusively on **voice volume detection and basic mob reaction hooks** ‚Äî leaves final behavior implementation to downstream mods.
- Compatible with dynamic difficulty scaling based on environmental sound factors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

- **Language**: Java (Forge)
- **Audio Library**: Voice Changer Mod

## üìà Example Behavior
